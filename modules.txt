Module 1: Data Parsing

This module, implemented in "readMap.c", is dedicated to reading and parsing map data from an input file. The parse_file function accepts a filename, reads its content line by line, extracts essential node and link information, and adjusts arrays to accommodate new entries. The parsed data is then appended to the respective arrays. After processing the entire file, the module writes the node and link data to an output file named "data.txt". This module ensures efficient and accurate data extraction for subsequent processing stages.

Module 2: Data Storage

This module aims to read parsed data from "data.txt," generated by Module 1, and store it in linked list structures. Implemented in "storeData.c," it features two main functions: free_list and store_data. The free_list function deallocates memory for node and link linked lists, while store_data reads the input file, extracts relevant node and link details, and appends new nodes and links to their respective linked lists. This module ensures organized and efficient data storage for further processing.

Module 3: Map Visualization

This module visualizes and interacts with map data, providing an intuitive representation of nodes and links. Utilizing the PROJ library for geographical coordinates and SDL for graphics, "visualization.c" initializes SDL, creates a window and renderer, sets up PROJ for map projection, and transforms coordinates. It iterates through nodes and links, rendering them on the SDL window, while managing zooming and panning. Finally, it releases allocated resources for proper cleanup upon exit.

Module 4: Path Calculation

This module calculates the shortest and fastest paths using Dijkstra algorithm and iteratively backtracks through them. "findRoute.c" will include a Dijkstra implementation, which takes graph representation, start and end nodes, and a mode flag for shortest or fastest paths. It uses a priority queue for unvisited nodes and updates distances/times and parent pointers. Another function backtracks from the end node using parent pointers, returning the path as a list of nodes to be traversed.

Module 5: Attributes editing

This module provides functions for editing attributes of nodes and links in a transportation network and saves updated data to original and parsed files. In "editAttribute.c", it sorts nodes and links using "qsort" and custom compare functions. It then updates the specified attribute of a node or link by iterating through the array and locating the matching ID. Attributes include length, vegetation, architecture, land-use, and speed for links, and latitude and longitude for nodes. This module facilitate consistent transportation network data management.

Module 6: Input Check

This module is implemented in "checkInput.c" to verify and process user inputs related to nodes and links in the transportation network. It provides functions for checking the reasonableness of node IDs, link IDs, speeds, and coordinates (latitude and longitude). If the input is invalid, the program prompts the user with appropriate error messages and guidance on how to correct the input. These functions ensure that the underlying data processing and operation algorithms receive valid input data by verifying user input, preventing erroneous results and potential crashes.

Module 7: Main Function

The "main.c" program integrates all modules to form a cohesive application. This module parses map data and stores it in both linked lists and arrays. It provides a user menu for selecting between calculating the shortest or fastest path, constraint route, or editing node and link attributes. Utilizing Dijkstra's algorithm, it displays the chosen path and presents an updated map visualization. The application also allows users to modify node and link attributes and saves the changes to data and parsed files.
